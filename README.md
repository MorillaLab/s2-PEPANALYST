Small Signalling Peptide Analysis in Plant Systems

This repository contains all the necessary to predicting small peptides in tomato, as a plant-system model, starting from the model provided in Tasnim et al., 2021 with the additional criteria of size less than or equal to 200 amino acids, the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide as novel embedded feature and the accuracy of GeoTop (Abaach et al., 2023)![sPEPANALYST.pdf]()
