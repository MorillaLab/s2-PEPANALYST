Small Signalling Peptide Analysis in Plant Systems

This repository encompasses everything required for predicting small peptides in tomato, employing as a plant-system model. The foundation of the model is derived from Tasnim et al., 2021, with added criteria including a size restriction of less than or equal to 200 amino acids. Furthermore, it incorporates the identification of an N-terminal signal peptide as a novel embedded feature. 
The accuracy assessment is performed using GeoTop (Abaach et al., 2023).
